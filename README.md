# RephraseFluxKI
Description
RephraseFluxKI is a paraphrasing app similar to ChatGPT and other AI tools. I developed this project as a practice exercise to improve my skills. It utilizes a large language model (LLM), FastAPI, and Streamlit, all packaged with Docker. With the help of ChatGPT, I built this website to showcase my work.
